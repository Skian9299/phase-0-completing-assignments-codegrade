# Complete Your First Software Engineering Assignment

## Learning Goals

- Understand the steps needed to complete an assignment
- Submit assignments in Canvas through CodeGrade

## Introduction

During this course, you will work on various assignments as you learn to code.
All assignments will be interactive pieces of curriculum that require some work.
Some assignments may ask you to follow a set of instructions, while others will
ask you to figure out your own solution to pass specific tests. This lesson is
your first assignment!

All assignments are hosted on GitHub. In order to work on them, however, you
will need to complete work on your local machine. Once you're done, you will
submit your assignment on a platform called CodeGrade through Canvas.

The general process is:

- Click the blue "Fork" button in Canvas
- Create a personal copy (a 'fork') of the assignment in GitHub
- Download your personal copy (referred to as 'cloning') to your computer
- Complete the required work
- Submit your completed work in Canvas through the CodeGrade window

In this assignment, you'll learn the workflow that you will be using to complete
your assignments. You can follow along with the steps in the videos below, or
continue reading to get a more detailed explanation of the process of working on
lessons in Canvas.

### A Quick Note on Organizing Work on Your Machine

Throughout this course, you will be downloading many assignments, so it is
important to keep your code organized. If you haven't yet, we recommend that you
go through the steps in
[the previous lesson](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-organizing-work-on-your-computer)
to set up a directory where you can keep all of your work for this course.

> **Note:** The process we'll go through in this lesson will create sub-folders
> automatically. Whenever you are starting a new assignment, navigate back to
> your main `prework` folder (`cd ~/Development/code/prework`) before cloning
> the assignment to ensure these sub-folders don't get created _within each
> other_.

### Accessing GitHub and Forking

All the lessons in this course have a corresponding repository (repo) in GitHub.
On this page in Canvas, you should see two icons in the **upper right** corner.
The first says **Fork**, which will open the lesson's GitHub repo. The third is
a flag, which you can use to submit an _issue_ for the lesson (e.g., if you find
a typo or other error).

To fork an assignment, click the **Fork** button to open its GitHub repo. In the
top right corner, you should see another button that says **Fork**. Click on
that, and you should get a screen that looks something like this:

![Screenshot of the 'Create a new fork' form](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/completing-assignments/fork-form.png)

In the **Owner** dropdown, select your GitHub username, then click the **Create
fork** button.

  <figcaption><sm>This is just a picture, the button is up at the top of the page.</sm></figcaption>
</figure>

Forking is a process which creates an exact copy of a collection of code and
files. Once you've created a fork on your own GitHub account, you will be able
to edit the files in the repository and write your own code solution without
interfering with the original copy.

Once your fork is ready, the next step is to download (**clone**) your new
repository to your local machine.

### Cloning to Your Local Machine

To download the repository for this lesson, make sure you're in your personal
fork on GitHub, then click the **Code** button. A pop-up will appear which shows
several options for cloning: **HTTPS**, **SSH**, and **GitHub CLI**. **Before
doing anything else**, be sure to switch to **SSH**. With **SSH** selected, you
should see what looks sort of like an email in the box below, starting with
`git@github.com:`. You should see your GitHub name after the `:`.

From here, click the copy button.

![clone-repo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/completing-assignments/clone-repo.gif)

Now, open your terminal and navigate to where you'd like to download the
assignment (e.g. `cd ~/Development/code`). Type `git clone` and a space, then
paste in the copied SSH link from GitHub. It should look something like this:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-user-name>/phase-0-completing-assignments.git
```

Press enter, and you should see a flurry of terminal activity.

> **Troubleshooting**: If you are a Mac user and you see the following message:
>
> `xcrun: error: invalid active developer path`
>
> You need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Run the following command to
> install them:
>
> ```console
> $ xcode-select --install
> ```
>
> And follow the prompts. Then try running the `git clone` command again. See
> [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52522566) for more
> details. Note that you may need to re-install `xcode-select` any time you
> update your Mac OS version.

Once the terminal gives you control to type again, a new folder with the GitHub
name of the assignment will have been created. Change directory into this folder
to access the assignment files.

```console
$ cd phase-0-completing-assignments
```

Now type `code .` to open up a text editor window with access to all of the
assignment's files. These instructions are now also available on your local
machine in `README.md`.

> Note: the first time you open a directory in Visual Studio Code, you'll see a
> message asking "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folders?" This
> is a [security feature][workspace-trust] of Visual Studio Code. It's safe to
> choose "Yes", and we recommend selecting the "Trust the authors of all the
> files in the parent folder" option to prevent this warning from coming up
> every time you open a lesson. Just be sure to download your code from trusted
> sources!

### Working on an Assignment

Most assignments will have tests that check your work and provide immediate
feedback in the terminal. We'll walk through some examples in upcoming lessons.

This assignment has a single test: check to see if you've correctly cloned this
assignment to your local machine. If you've followed the steps above, you've
completed everything you need to do to pass the test; all that is left to do is
run it.

First, run `npm install` to install the tools necessary to run the test. You
should again see a flurry of text as dependencies are installed. Once your
terminal finished with that command, run `npm test`. You should see the results
of your test. By cloning this assignment down, you've already passed one test!

```console
This assignment
  âœ“ has been correctly cloned to your local environment
  1) has a file named myfile.md


1 passing (5ms)
1 failing
```

> **Note:** If you did not receive a passing test, or if your terminal produced
> some sort of error, walk through the steps in this lesson again and make sure
> you've followed each one. If you got a "command not found" error, go back to
> the Node.js installation lesson for your OS and go through the steps provided
> there to make sure Node was installed correctly. If you're still receiving
> errors, we recommend going back through all local environment setup
> instructions again to ensure everything is set up properly.

However, there is still one test not passing. Terminal gave us a detailed error
saying why we did not pass the test:

```console
1) This assignment
      has a file named myfile.md:
    AssertionError: No file named 'myfile.md' found. Create one in the root of the assignment's directory: value: expected './myfile.md' to exist
```

We can use this error to figure out what we need to do to pass it. In this case,
we just need to create a file called `myfile.md` inside the assignment
directory. Let's create it with the CLI commands we just learned.

In terminal, make sure you're in the root of the assignment directory
(`phase-0-completing-assignments`). If you're not already, `cd` into it. Then
use the `touch` command to create `myfile.md`.

To make sure it was created successfully in the correct area, use the `ls`
command. The output should look like:

```console
CONTRIBUTING.md         README.md               node_modules            package.json
LICENSE.md              myfile.md               package-lock.json       test
```

Now when you run `npm test` again, both tests should now be passing!

This is the general workflow you will follow when working on assignments with
tests. Install the tools needed for the test, then run the test initially to see
what tests you need to pass. Work on the assignment with those tests in mind. As
you work, you can run `npm test` as many times as you'd like to test your work.
Once all your tests are passing, it's time submit your assignment - or is it?

### Pushing your Changes to GitHub

If you go to your **forked** version of the assignment on GitHub, you'll see
that the `myfile.md` file you created is not there. This is because you only
made the change on your _local clone_. Changes that you make on a locally cloned
repository are not automatically synced to the repo up on GitHub. You have to
manually sync the changes. This is a good thing, it gives you more control over
what changes get "pushed" up to the GitHub repo and when.

The process requires three terminal commands:

1. `git add`
1. `git commit`
1. `git push`

We will learn about these commands in far more detail later on. We'll just cover
the surface basics for now that will allow you to turn in your assignments.

These commands should be run within the directory with changes to push. For
example with this assignment, you should be running the following commands
within the `phase-0-completing-assignments` directory.

#### Track changes with `git add`

This command lets us tell git what changes and files we want to sync within a
repo. You can specify certain files to track, or you can track all files at once
that have changes to sync.

To track specific files, you just need to add the file name as arguments. For
example:

```bash
git add file1.md file2.md
```

To track all files at once, you can use a period as an argument instead `.`:

```bash
git add .
```

Let's go ahead and track our change by using the `git add .` shortcut.

#### Save changes with `git commit`

Once you've tracked all the changes you want to save with `git add`, the next
step is to save all those changes at once. This is done with `git commit`. To
make a commit, the command is:

```bash
git commit -m "short message briefly explaining the changes saved in this commit"
```

Any time you commit something, you should include a message with it to explain
what changes are actually in the commit. These messages should be one line and
short. The `-m` flag says we want to add one and should be followed by the
message in quotes.

Let's commit our tracked change. In terminal, run:

```bash
git commit -m "created myfile.md"
```

#### Push changes with `git push`

We've now tracked and saved our changes - but they're _still_ not up on the
GitHub repo. That's because we haven't told Git where we want these saved
changes to go. We need to do so with `git push`. The full command is:

```bash
git push <remote> <branch>
```

We will learn what a **remote** and **branch** are in greater detail later on.

For now, consider the remote as the repository that is on GitHub - in this case,
the forked version of the assignment you created earlier. It would be tedious if
we had to copy and paste the entire repository link every time we want to push a
change, however. Instead, these remotes use aliases that point to the URL. When
cloning a repository down to your machine, an alias gets automatically created
for you called `origin`, which is the remote we will push to. You can see this
yourself by running the command `git remote -v`. This will list the remotes your
repository has.

Then consider a branch as the version of the code you want to push the changes
to. In most cases, this branch will be called `main` or `master` for older
repositories. You can check what branch your repository uses by using the
command `git branch`, which will list all the branches your repository has. For
this assignment, it should be `master`.

Putting that all together, we can now completely fill out the `git push` command
and push our changes up:

```bash
git push origin master
```

Now, finally, when you load your forked version of the assignment on GitHub, you
should see the `myfile.md` file! With all your work now available on GitHub, you
can finally submit the assignment.

### Submitting an Assignment on CodeGrade

All assignments for this program utilize a tool called CodeGrade to accept and
automatically grade your work.

To submit your work for grading, head back to the assignment on Canvas and
scroll down to the bottom of the page. There, you should see a button that says
"Load \<Assignment Name> in a new window". For this lesson, it should look like:

![Load Complete Your First Software Engineering Assignment in a new window button](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/completing-assignments/open-codegrade-btn.png)

Click on that button, and a new window of the CodeGrade interface should open
up. As you haven't submitted an assignment for this lab yet, click on the
"Create submission" button. On the next page that opens, click on the "GitHub"
button. As long as you're logged onto GitHub, this step should connect CodeGrade
to your account.

> If you were not logged in and the connection is unsuccessful where you don't
> see a list of your repos, log in and try again. If you were logged in and it
> still did not work, try again, but instead of clicking the "GitHub" button,
> click the "Or manually connect your Git repository" link underneath. CodeGrade
> will walk you through the manual set up, be sure to read and follow their
> instructions carefully.

![Gif showing the CodeGrade interface, creating a submission, and connecting to GitHub](https://imgur.com/aXVrPtW.gif)

Once your GitHub account is connected, whether automatically or manually, you
should see a list of your repos in the CodeGrade window. Find the repo that
matches the assignment you're submitting, in this case
`phase-0-completing-assignments`, and click the blue "Connect" button.

When CodeGrade finishes connecting the repo, it should show you a success
message with a link to view your submission. Click on that link.

![Gif showing how to connect a GitHub repo on CodeGrade](https://imgur.com/8hLcb3O.gif)

On this new page, there are three different tabs: Code, Feedback Overview, and
AutoTest.

The _Code_ tab is as it sounds, all the code you submitted. The _Feedback
Overview_ is where you can see feedback on your work from instructors if they've
provided any.

The _AutoTest_ tab is what we'll focus on in this lesson. This tab is what runs
the test that automatically grades your work. It will take some time, and you
can see the progress in the small box on the right side of the Setup section.
When it's done, it will say "Done" and your score will update in the Automatic
Tests section.

![Gif showing the AutoTest running and completing](https://imgur.com/G5pzKwr.gif)

If you don't pass, don't fret, you can still fix it! You can click on the
test(s) within the Automatic Tests section to see which ones failed. Then, you
can fix those errors within your local version of the repo, and go through the
process of using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to push your changes.
CodeGrade will then automatically re-run the test when it detects changes have
been made to the GitHub repo.

To see the results after you've already made the initial submission, navigate
back to CodeGrade through the button on Canvas. Instead of on "Create
submission", click on the "Latest submission" button to get taken back to the
AutoTest page.

![Gif showing how to navigate back to AutoTest via the Latest submission button](https://imgur.com/iDeIorX.gif)

Whew, that was a lot. While it will take some time in the beginning, the more
assignments you complete and submit, the easier the process should become. If
you ever forget a step, that's OK. Come back to this lesson as many times as you
need until it becomes second nature.

## Types of Assignments

For most assignments, you will go through the process we just walked through. In
our curriculum, these assignments are often referred to as **labs** â€” coding
lessons that include tests. There are a few other types of assignments, though,
that require slightly different submission steps:

- **Code-alongs:** These also require code, but will guide you through what
  needs to be written. There are no tests to pass, but you will still need to go
  through forking, cloning, and pushing your changes up for your own
  safekeeping.
- **Portfolio Projects:** For these assignments, you'll be building fully
  functional applications. Some guidelines and requirements will be provided,
  but it will be up to you to design and create your own app. These will
  eventually become the projects you showcase to potential employers! You will
  submit your projects in Canvas by submitting a link to your GitHub repo.
- **Blog Submissions:** Blogs are a required part of our Software Engineering
  courses. They help to develop your online presence and are a great way to
  reinforce the concepts you learn. You'll write your blog posts on a different
  platform, but submit links to them in Canvas.

## Submitting Projects and Blogs

For both portfolio projects and blog posts, you'll need to manually submit a
link to your work on Canvas. While viewing the assignment, you should see a
**Submit Assignment** button in the upper-right section of the page.

![submit assignment button](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/canvas-welcome/submit-assignment-canvas.png)

Clicking this button will bring you to the bottom of the page where you can
submit a URL link to your work.

![submit assignment form](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/canvas-welcome/submit-assignment-canvas-form.png)

Upon submission you should see confetti appear, indicating that your submission
has been accepted.

> **Note:** It is possible to submit lab and code-along assignments manually
> this way. However, the assignment will only be marked as **Submitted**, not
> **Complete**.
